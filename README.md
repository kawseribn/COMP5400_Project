# COMP5400_Project
A SQL based project focusing on DDL and DML methodologies.

To explore relational database management systems (RDBMS) and demonstrate meaningful relationships in synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data, we developed a database following the OMOP-CDM guidelines \cite{OHDSIOMOPDatabase}, inspired by the All of Us workbench. It is worth mentioning that we have generated all the relational tables shown in this report inside the All of Us workbench as well. In this report, we use synthetic EHR data, which mimics real patient data while ensuring privacy and confidentiality, to demonstrate our databaseâ€™s capabilities in managing and analyzing health information
